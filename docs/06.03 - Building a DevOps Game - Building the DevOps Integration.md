# Power Apps: A DevOps Game - Integrate with the Azure DevOps connector

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

This article will focus on feedback, specifically from events that happen with **Azure DevOps**. We will first look at subscription setup and notifications to team members and interested parties. From there we will dive deeper into feedback events, how they work, how they can be filtered and delivered. Finally we will review a real world example utilizing service hooks, **Power Automate** and **Microsoft Teams**.

## Sources

Sources of Azure DevOps events that impact our delivery can come from virtually any area of the platform including work items, pipelines, source control, testing and artifact delivery. For each one of these events, such as completed work items, we can setup visualizations such as charts based on defined queries. Service hooks and notification subscriptions can be configured to allow real time reporting of events to external parties and systems allowing for us to stay in a state of continuous communication and collaboration.

## Azure DevOps Connector

[The **Azure DevOps connector**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#actions), available for both **Power Automate** and **Azure Logic Apps**, contain specific actions and triggers that allow Makers to work with the **Azure DevOps REST API**. 

### Actions and Triggers

The **Azure DevOps connector** contains both Triggers and Actions. [Triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#triggers) can be thought of as service hooks, described in the article "", allowing for integrations and interested parties to register on notable events such as [work item changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/#when-a-work-item-is-updated). Actions allow Makers the ability to send messages back and forth to Azure DevOps. Scenarios might include creating and querying work items, which would be helpful for tracking active work for each sprint or even creating an Issue on error of a Power Automate Flow.

## The Azure DevOps Connector Action and the REST API 

The Azure DevOps Connector action "Send an HTTP request to Azure DevOps" allows Makers an unbelievable amount of flexibility when working with Azure DevOps. Any action available for the REST API can be utilized by the connector. The action is so flexible that if one of the pre built actions, such as Queue a Build, doesn't provide conditions required, we can simply issue the same request using this action in its place.  This is really a testament to the design and interoperability that both of these services offer.

I began working with this action when I wanted to explore other options outside of writing .NET or PowerShell. My goal was to build a fully functional DevOps Canvas App that would allow team members to interact with Azure DevOps without the need to login and watch timers and action icons progress. With that in mind, I'll detail my experience working with the Azure DevOps Connector and Microsoft Power Apps to build a custom front end solution.

## Creating a Game using Canvas Apps and Power Automate

Working with Power Apps Canvas Apps, I was quickly able to design multiple screens to host my menu and my different pages that would interact with the Azure DevOps REST API.

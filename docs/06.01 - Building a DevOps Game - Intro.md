# Power Apps: A DevOps Game - Introduction

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

## Who is this article for?

The intent of this series is to describe the tools I used to better familiarize myself with **Power Apps**. If you are an experienced maker, consider skipping ahead to the [troubleshooting](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/power-apps-a-devops-game---troubleshooting) and monitoring articles. If not, follow along we we start with a concept and build towards a production ready app!

## Building a Custom Azure DevOps User Experience

When I was younger I loved playing video games, especially role playing games or RPGs. Over the 2019 winter break I took some time to try a new concept: How can I take something that may be considered somewhat dry by some, and turn it on its head and make it fun. With that in mind, I decided to create an interactive game, writing zero code, that could help include team members from all backgrounds.

The app needed to be functional, informative and fun. What could be more fun than using a popular video game from my past?

### From Mind to (virtual) Paper

What I had in mind was recreating the style of a turn based RPG. I knew I needed a start screen, some action screen for my hero and screens for various types of stats. Using **Microsoft Whiteboard** I quickly came up with a crude idea of what I needed to design.

## Next Steps

This article serves as the introduction to building a **Canvas App**. From this point, we will continue our journey by leveraging the **Canvas App Designer** to design, **Power Automate** flows to integrate, **Azure DevOps** to deploy, **Power Apps Monitor Tool** to troubleshoot and **Azure Application Insights** to monitor.

# Power Apps: A DevOps Game - Designing the Canvas App

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

This article will focus on feedback, specifically from events that happen with **Azure DevOps**. We will first look at subscription setup and notifications to team members and interested parties. From there we will dive deeper into feedback events, how they work, how they can be filtered and delivered. Finally we will review a real world example utilizing service hooks, **Power Automate** and **Microsoft Teams**.

## Creating a Game using Canvas Apps

### Creating a new Canvas App 

Opening up the **Power Apps Maker Portal**, I was able to quickly create an app using a phone layout without a template. Its key to point out that if you're relatively new to **Power Apps**, the **templates serve as quick start guides to help better understand working with screens, transitions, collections, etc.** I highly recommend using one of these if you're new.

### Creating Screens

Starting off in the designer studio, I create a screen for my start screen. Designing the screen was relatively painless, since I was able to use and take advantage of most of the controls and images that already existed.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/CreateNewScreen.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

Using the screen templates, I created my initial four screens from my whiteboard drawing and named them ***DevOpsGameStartScreen***, ***GetBuildSummary***, ***GetBuildLogs*** and ***GetBuildsScreen***.

### Adding Buttons and Textboxes

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/InsertBar.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

Using the insert bar, shown above, I added textboxes for my DevOps project and buttons to help transition between screens.

Using the **"OnSelect**" property of my ***Get Builds*** button, I was able to add the **Navigate** method and call my ***GetBuildsScreen***. The **Navigate** method allows me to choose which screen and how I want to transition, making my app more fluid and appealing.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/HomeScreenGetBuildsNavigateMethod.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

Working with **Power Apps Canvas Apps**, I was quickly able to design multiple screens to host my menu and my different pages that would interact with the **Azure DevOps** project. In the image below you can see the various screens used by the DevOps Game.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/DesignerAllUp-Pages.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

Each screen encompasses a new area for team members to explore and work or play. This includes **<u>reviewing previous builds (reviewing stats), queuing new builds (earning points) and monitoring progress</u>**. The further I went into the design the more ideas came to mind to make an engaging game that would keep my heroes coming back for more! For instance, along the way, if a user found a new way to optimize the process, they could gain multipliers and score more points on a team leaderboard or track previous work to see where the wrong path may have been taken!

### UpdateContext and Working with Variables

Storing user or application input as we navigate screens is an important topic to cover. In this example from 2019, I relied on the **UpdateContext** method to help store data from both my heroes and from actions within the application, such as **Power Automate** flow responses. **<u>What I found worked best for me was to use JSON and build a data transfer object to help with transitioning screen contexts.</u>**

The image below shows how to create a variable for use within the application using the "**OnVisible**" property.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/HomeScreenOnVisibleSourceCode.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

This next image, which is the same as above, shows how to use the multiple functions. In this case I am **<u>setting and updating global and project settings</u>** before navigating to the next screen.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/HomeScreenGetBuildsNavigateMethod.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

Finally, this image shows how I can use the **UpdateContext** function to update the data on the screen from a **Power Automate** flow.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/GetBuildUpdateContext.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

## Building Towards the DevOps Project

Knowing that I wanted to build an interface that surfaced data from a DevOps platform, in this case **Azure DevOps**, I knew I had to do a couple of things. First, I needed to learn the lingo and more about how **Azure DevOps** works. For that, I would suggest reviewing the documentation, specifically the articles for the **[Azure DevOps connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/visualstudioteamservices/)** and the **[Azure DevOps REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops-rest-6.1)**.

### Author's Note

At this point of the article, you should **<u>review and reference the [integrate](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/power-apps-a-devops-game---integrate-with-the-azure-devops-connector) and [troubleshoot](https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/crminthefield/posts/power-apps-a-devops-game---troubleshooting) articles to better understand some of the challenges presented and the solutions taken</u>**. While this solution worked for me, I would suggest taking into account your requirements and building towards a strategy that is flexible and maintainable.

### Action Screen (*Queueing a new Build Screen*)

Each build within the game represents a new opportunity for users to gain points. Each successful action ([*Task*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/tasks?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)) in the build gains points while each action that fails or doesn't run will take points away. If a build is completely successful a multiplier is added. 

To begin, we simulate a hero's turn within our RPG by displaying the name, current stats, and action button.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildDefinitionScreenQueueBuildCode.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

When action is selected, using the **UpdateContext** function, a screen variable is updated which signals the screen to display the choose an action container.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildDefinitionScreen.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

In the image above, I used a container control to house the picklist, textboxes and button used to kick off the hero's action. In the image below, the [container](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-container) is shown with the controls indented, a visual cue that they reside within the container.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildDefinitionScreen-Controls.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

When a build is kicked off, a  timer is kicked off that requests updates every few seconds. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildOnTimeEnd.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

The timer object is used heavily in this screen. Utilizing the timer's "[**OnTimerEnd**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-timer)", along with the "**Duration**" property, I can poll **Azure DevOps** for updates on our build.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildScreen.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

Each time an action is completed, one of the opponents is defeated, allowing for our hero to progress. The below image shows the **Filter** method used to  display only remaining tasks, represented by the mages.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildCurrentBuildTImeline.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

If any of the tasks within the build fails, the hero is defeated. The image below shows how we can manipulate the images used to switch from a standing hero to a downed hero.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildScreenFailed.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

Using the **UpdateContext** function, I was able to update the ***CurrentBuildTimeline*** variable. This variable contained the data used in the **Gallery** object to display the bad guys as pending or running tasks.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/QueueBuildOnTimeEnd.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

### Result Screen (*Reviewing Previous Builds Screen*)

For the result screen, once we completed our action, I wanted to show the summary of the build as well as some other information. The idea was to create something that resembled an old RPG post battle screen complete with avatar and "damage" (tasks successfulness).

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/GetBuildInformationScreen.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

On this screen I want to point out the use of containers and tables. In the image below you can see some of the practices I took when designing. When designing screens and objects, be mindful of other makers and name everything something that is readable and distinguishable. In this screen the table name resembles the name of the **Power Automate** flow used to populate it. The container describes the data and objects within.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/GetBuildSummaryObjects.JPG"  />

### Summary Screen (*Builds Screen*)

The summary screen needs to show heroes previous actions taken and how they are trending. Hopefully, we trend positively and accumulate points! By using the badges from **Azure Pipelines**, we can easily visualize where we may be trending downward. The image below shows the pipeline badge indicating a failure.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/MonitoringPowerPlatform/master/Artifacts/DevOps/RestApi-GetBuilds-CanvasApp.JPG" style="zoom:50%;" />

This screen uses a [Gallery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-gallery) control to display the builds that have run in the DevOps project. In fact this screen was the start of the entire Power App! Utilizing the screen templates I was able to choose a vertical scrolling gallery and begin linking to connected data sources.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliyoussefi/DevOpsGame/main/docs/Design/CreateNewScreenVeritcalGallery.JPG" style="zoom:75%;" />

## Next Steps

In this article I laid out the beginning steps taken to design a canvas app, from mock up to reality. We started by creating a screen and adding user controls such as text boxes and buttons. We explored objects deeper looking at how we can fire **Power Automate** flows using events from those objects. We looked at the **Navigate** method to transition between screens. We reviewed how to pass information across screens using the **UpdateContext** method. 

At this point, I would recommend reviewing the source code for the DevOps game or starting from scratch with a predefined template. These templates can serve as a valuable learning tool to understand items such as **Tables**, **Collections**, **Data Cards**, etc. Once the design of the app has been crafted, look into the native capabilities of **Canvas Apps**. If your requirements include working with other systems, consider connecting to a **Power Automate** flow.

In the next article, we will focus specifically on the integration between **Canvas App** and **Power Automate**, leveraging the **Azure DevOps** connector as the example.

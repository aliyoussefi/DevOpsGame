# A DevOps Game: Designing the Canvas App

## Summary

[DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/) has become more and more ingrained into our **Power Platform** project lifecycle. Work item tracking and feedback tools for teamwork. Continuous integration and delivery for code changes and solution deployments. Automated testing for assurance, compliance and governance considerations. Microsoft's tool, **[Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-devops/#culture)** provides native capabilities to plan, work, collaborate and deliver. Each step along the way in our [**Power Platform DevOps** journey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools) can be tracked and monitored which will be the primary objective of this article.

This article will focus on feedback, specifically from events that happen with **Azure DevOps**. We will first look at subscription setup and notifications to team members and interested parties. From there we will dive deeper into feedback events, how they work, how they can be filtered and delivered. Finally we will review a real world example utilizing service hooks, **Power Automate** and **Microsoft Teams**.

This article builds on the introduction and DevOps integration articles. Please review those articles before proceeding to better understand the mindset and technologies we are building.



## Building a Custom Azure DevOps User Experience

When I was younger I loved playing video games, especially role playing games or RPGs. Over the 2019 winter break I took some time to try a new concept: How can I take something that may be considered somewhat dry by some, and turn it on its head and make it fun. With that in mind, I decided to create an interactive game, writing zero code, that could help include team members from all backgrounds.

### <insert home screen>

The app needed to be functional, informative and fun. What could be more fun than using a popular video game from my past?

### From Mind to (virtual) Paper

What I had in mind was recreating the style of a turn based RPG. I knew I needed a start screen, some action screen for my hero and screens for various types of stats. Using **Microsoft Whiteboard** I quickly came up with a crude idea of what I needed to design.

## Creating a Game using Canvas Apps

### Creating a new Canvas App 

Opening up the **Power Apps Maker Portal**, I was able to quickly create an app using a phone layout without a template. Its key to point out that if you're relatively new to **Power Apps**, the templates serve as quick start guides to help better understand working with screens, transitions, collections, etc. I highly recommend using one of these if you're new.

### Creating Screens

Starting off in the designer studio, I create a screen for my start screen. Designing the screen was relatively painless, since I was able to use and take advantage of most of the controls and images that already existed.

<insert Create new Screen image>

Using the screen templates, I created my initial four screens from my whiteboard drawing and named them ***DevOpsGameStartScreen***, ***GetBuildSummary***, ***GetBuildLogs*** and ***GetBuildsScreen***.



### Adding Buttons and Textboxes

Using the insert bar, shown above, I added textboxes for my DevOps project and buttons to help transition between screens.

<inset home screen>

Using the **"OnSelect**" property of my ***Get Builds*** button, I was able to add the Navigate method and call my ***GetBuildsScreen***. The **Navigate** method allows me to choose which screen and how I want to transition, making my app more fluid and appealing.

<insert Navigate method image>

Working with Power Apps Canvas Apps, I was quickly able to design multiple screens to host my menu and my different pages that would interact with the Azure DevOps project.

<insert side bar navigation>

Each screen encompasses a new area for team members to explore and work or play. This includes reviewing previous builds (reviewing stats), queuing new builds (earning points) and monitoring progress. The further I went into the design the more ideas came to mind to make an engaging game that would keep my heroes coming back for more! For instance, along the way, if a user found a new way to optimize the process, they could gain multipliers and score more points on a team leaderboard or track previous work to see where the wrong path may have been taken!

### UpdateContext and Working with Variables

Storing user or application input as we navigate screens is an important topic to cover. In this example from 2019, I relied on the UpdateContext method to help store data from both my heroes and from actions within the application, such as **Power Automate** flow responses. **<u>What I found worked best for me was to use JSON and build a data transfer object to help with transitioning screen contexts.</u>**

The image below shows how to create a variable for use within the application using the "**OnVisible**" property.

<insert onvisible>

This next image, which is the same as above, shows how to use the multiple functions. In this case I am setting global and updating project settings before navigating to the next screen.

<insert get builds image>

Finally, this image shows how I can use the **UpdateContext** function to update the data on the screen from a Power Automate flow.

<insert GetBuilds UpdateCOntext>

## Building Towards the DevOps Project

Knowing that I wanted to build an interface that surfaced data from a DevOps platform, in this case **Azure DevOps**, I knew I had to do a couple of things. First, I needed to learn the lingo and more about how **Azure DevOps** works. For that, I would suggest reviewing the documentation, specifically these articles: 

I also knew, that to interact with the **Azure DevOps** platform, I needed to use the **Azure DevOps** connector. The connector would allow me to gather information and perform actions.

### Author's Note

At this point of the article, you should review and reference the integrate and troubleshoot to better understand some of the challenges presented and the solutions taken. While this solution worked for me, I would suggest taking into account your requirements and building towards a strategy that is flexible and maintainable.

### Action Screen (*Queueing a new Build Screen*)

Each build within the game represents a new opportunity for users to gain points. Each successful action (Task) in the build gains points while each action that fails or doesn't run will take points away. If a build is completely successful a multiplier is added.

<Show a build definition>

When a build is kicked off, a  timer is kicked off that requests updates every few seconds. Each time an action is completed, one of the opponents is defeated, allowing for our hero to progress.

<show downed mage>

The timer object is used heavily in this screen. Utilizing the timer's "**OnTimerEnd**", along with the "**Duration**" property, I can poll **Azure DevOps** for updates on our build.

<show timer ontimeend>

Using the **UpdateContext** function, I was able to update the ***CurrentBuildTimeline*** variable. This variable contained the data used in the **Gallery** object to display the bad guys as pending or running tasks.

### Result Screen (*Reviewing Previous Builds Screen*)

For the result screen, once we completed our action, I wanted to show the summary of the build as well as some other information. The idea was to create something that resembled an old RPG post battle screen complete with avatar and "damage" (tasks successfulness).

<insert build final screen>

On this screen I want to point out the use of containers and tables. In the image below you can see some of the practices I took when designing. When designing screens and objects, be mindful of other makers and name everything something that is readable and distinguishable. In this screen the table name resembles the name of the **Power Automate** flow used to populate it. The container describes the data and objects within.

<insert buld summary object>

### Summary Screen (*Builds Screen*)

The summary screen needs to show heroes previous actions taken and how they are trending. Hopefully, we trend positively and accumulate points! By using the badges from **Azure Pipelines**, we can easily visualize where we may be trending downward. The image below shows the pipeline badge indicating a failure.
